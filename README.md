# Bike_Demand_Prediction
To predict the demand of bike considering the various factors
# Steps to approach the problem
1. Read the dataset </br>
2. preliminary analysis of data and droping unnecessary variable which do not add value to the prediction </br>
3. Visualise data by plotting various graphs in order to see the effect of various features affecting the demand </br>
4. Check multiple linear regression assumptions: </br>
i. Normality </br>
ii.correlation </br>
iii. Multi-collinearity </br>
iv.Auto-correlation </br>
v.Sample size </br>
5. Dropping irrelevant variables </br>
6. Creating dummies </br>
7. splitting Test and Train dataset </br>
8. Fit and score the model </br>
RMSE = 0.3809880049817043 </br>
RMSLE = 3.4119761418839745
